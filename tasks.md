## Technical Considerations

### Database Migration Notes
- Need to handle existing contacts gracefully
- Primary email will be populated from current email field
- Secondary fields will be NULL initially
- New fields should be optional to maintain compatibility

### Frontend Display Strategy
- Use responsive grid for contact table
- Group email/phone fields visually
- Show field labels (Primary/Secondary) clearly
- Handle empty fields gracefully
- Consider mobile-first responsive design

### Industry Options
Suggested industry categories:
- Technology
- Healthcare
- Finance
- Education
- Construction
- Manufacturing
- Retail
- Consulting
- Real Estate
- Marketing
- Other

### Form Organization
Group related fields:
1. Basic Info: Name, Company
2. Contact Methods: Primary Email, Secondary Email, Primary Phone, Secondary Phone
3. Business Info: Industry, Website, Address
4. CRM Data: Source, Status, Notes

## Risk Mitigation
- Always backup database before migrations
- Test thoroughly in development environment
- Use database transactions for data migrations
- Implement rollback plan for schema changes
- Monitor application performance after deployment

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All existing contacts retain their data
- [ ] New fields are properly integrated
- [ ] Forms work smoothly with validation
- [ ] Table displays all information clearly
- [ ] Mobile responsive design maintained
- [ ] No performance degradation
